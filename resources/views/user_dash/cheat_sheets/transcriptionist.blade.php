<p><strong>Description: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transcriptionists create written copies of live speech or dictated audio, and they work in all kinds of environments, including court rooms, law offices, physician practices and hospitals.

Transcriptionists typically work in one of two fields: medical, in which they transcribe diagnostic test results, referrals and operative reports for patient files, and legal, in which they act as court reporters to transcribe dialogue at hearings and depositions.</span></p>
